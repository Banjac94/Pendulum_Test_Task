I made very simple version for now, and you need to put in my code your path to Sample Files. So you just need to put in main.cpp on line 34 your path instead of my path.
And also I made this in QT Creator 6.0.0, and in case that you are using some older version you also need to uncomment Macro in main.cpp on line 14. 
If you have some problems, feel free to contact me.
