I made very simple version for now. When the application starts, you need to select where is located on your PC folder Sample Files, and when you find it, just click once o folder "SampleFile" and after that select "SelectFolder", and after that you need to write the name of file which is going to be presented on window, and also you will see in Application Output values and timestamps. 
I made this in QT Creator 6.0.0, and in case that you are using some older version you also need to uncomment Macro in main.cpp on line 14. 
If you have some problems, feel free to contact me.
